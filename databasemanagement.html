    <h1>This page is about database management system:</h1>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>Data, in the context of databases, refers to all the single items that are stored in a database, either individually or as a set. Data in a database is primarily stored in database tables, which are organized into columns that dictate the data types stored therein</p>
    <h2>Information</h2>
    <p>Information in a database is a collection of structured data that is organized and stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are used to store large amounts of data in one place so that organizations can easily access, manage, update, and retrieve it.</p>
    <h2>Metadata</h2>
    <p>Metadata in a database is information that describes the structure, contents, and context of the database. It's also known as "data about data" and can include information such as:
        Table and column names and types
        Table relationships
        Data constraints
        Indexes
        Views
        Other database objects
        Data source and history.
        </p>
    <h2>Database</h2>
    <p>A database is a structured collection of data that is usually stored electronically in a computer system. It can contain any type of data, including words, numbers, images, videos, and files. Databases are used to store and manage large amounts of data, and they can be used to support a wide range of activities, including data storage, data analysis, and data management</p>
    <h2>Tuples</h2>
    <p>A tuple is a fundamental unit of data that represents a single row or record in a database table. Tuples are also known as rows or records. </p>
    <h2>Table</h2>
    <p>Tables are fundamental objects in a database that store and organize related data in a row-and-column format, similar to a spreadsheet. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field within that record. Tables can also have properties that control their appearance and behavior. </p>
    <h2>Fields</h2>
    <p>A field in a database is a column or attribute that contains a specific type of data and defines the values each record can have in a table. Fields can be used to store information such as names, addresses, or other data.</p>
    <h2>Domain</h2>
    <p>A domain in a database is a set of values that can be assigned to a column or attribute, and it establishes the data type and range of values that can be stored in that field. Domains can be built-in types, like strings or integers, or custom types that define constraints on the data.</p>
    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <p>Database constraints are properties that restrict data in various ways.</p>
    <h2>Keys</h2>
    <p>It is used to uniquely identify any record or row of data from the table. It is also used to establish and identify relationships between tables.</p>
